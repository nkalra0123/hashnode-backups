To check commands running in redis

To log all Redis commands that are being executed by Redis clients, including `redis-cli`, you can enable Redis slow log.

Redis slow log is a feature that logs Redis commands that exceed a specified execution time threshold. By default, Redis slow log is disabled. To enable Redis slow log, you need to set the `slowlog-log-slower-than` configuration parameter to a positive value in your Redis configuration file, or by using the `CONFIG SET` command.

For example, to enable Redis slow log for commands that take longer than 1000 microseconds (1 millisecond) to execute, you can add the following line to your Redis configuration file:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> CONFIG SET slowlog-log-slower-than 1000
OK
```

After enabling Redis slow log, Redis will log all commands that exceed the specified execution time threshold, along with their execution time and the client that executed them. You can view the Redis slow log entries by using the `SLOWLOG GET` command.

To view the Redis slow log in real-time, you can use the `redis-cli` tool with the `MONITOR` command. The `MONITOR` command displays all Redis commands that are being executed by Redis clients, including `redis-cli`. To enable `MONITOR` mode, simply run the following command in `redis-cli`:

```bash
redis-cli monitor
```

This will display all Redis commands as they are executed, along with their arguments and the client that executed them.

Note that enabling Redis slow log and `MONITOR` mode can have a performance impact on Redis, especially if your Redis instance is handling a large number of commands. Therefore, it's recommended to use these features only for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, and to disable them when they're not needed.
