# Learning Kubernetes - Part 4

**Pods**

Pods are the basic building blocks of Kubernetes and represent a single instance of an application. They can contain one or more containers and are responsible for exposing the application to the rest of the cluster.

Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address and runs in a shared network namespace. This means that all containers within a Pod can communicate with each other using [localhost](http://localhost), and they can also communicate with other Pods and the outside world using their unique IP address.

Pods are created and managed by other Kubernetes objects, such as **Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets**. These objects are responsible for ensuring that the desired number of replicas of the application are running and handling the deployment and scaling of the application.

Pods are ephemeral, meaning that they are not intended to be long-lived. If a Pod goes down or is deleted, it will be replaced by a new instance. This allows Kubernetes to automatically recover from failures and ensure that the application remains available.

In summary, Pods are the basic units of deployment in Kubernetes and are responsible for exposing applications to the rest of the cluster. They are created and managed by other Kubernetes objects and are intended to be ephemeral, with new instances being created to replace failed or deleted Pods.
