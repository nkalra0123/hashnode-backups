Using Git Hooks to reduce build failures, and how to share Git Hooks

When developing software in a team, it is essential to have a consistent development environment. This includes ensuring that all code changes adhere to the same coding standards and quality checks. One way to enforce this consistency is by using Git hooks.

Git hooks are scripts that can be run before or after certain Git actions, such as committing code or pushing changes to a remote repository. In this blog, we will discuss how to use Git hooks to run Maven's `verify` goal before each Git push and write an installation script to install the Git hook on every developer machine.

Using Git Hooks to Run Maven Verify before Each Git Push

To use Git hooks to run Maven's `verify` goal before each Git push, follow these steps:

1. Create a pre-push Git hook
    
2. The first step is to create a pre-push Git hook. A pre-push Git hook is a script that is executed before the Git push command is executed. To create a pre-push Git hook, create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks/` directory of your Git repository. If the `.git/hooks/` directory does not exist, create it.
    
    1. Add code to the pre-push Git hook
        
    
    Next, add the following code to the `pre-push` Git hook:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    mvn verify
    
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Maven verify failed. Commit aborted."
      exit 1
    fi
    ```
    
    This code runs Maven's `verify` goal before each Git push. If the `verify` goal fails, the script will print an error message and exit with a non-zero status code, which will prevent the Git push from executing.
    
    1. Make the pre-push Git hook executable
        
        ```bash
        chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
        ```
        
        This command sets the execute permission on the `pre-push` Git hook script, allowing it to be executed.
        
        1. Test the pre-push Git hook
            
        
        Test the `pre-push` Git hook by attempting to push some code changes to the Git repository. If Maven's `verify` goal fails, the Git push will be aborted, and an error message will be displayed.
        

### How to share git hooks with the team

writing an Installation Script to Install the Git Hook on Every Developer Machine

To ensure that all developers on your team are using the pre-push Git hook, you can write an installation script to install the Git hook on every developer machine. Here's how:

1. Create an installation script
    

Create a shell script named [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) that contains the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

HOOKS_DIR=".git/hooks/"
HOOK_NAME="pre-push"
HOOK_TARGET="$(pwd)/$HOOK_NAME"

echo "Installing Git hook $HOOK_NAME..."

cp "$HOOK_NAME" "$HOOKS_DIR"
chmod +x "$HOOK_TARGET"

echo "Git hook $HOOK_NAME installed successfully."
```

1. Make the installation script executable
    

Make the [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) installation script executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install-git-hooks.sh
```

This command sets the execute permission on the [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) installation script, allowing it to be executed.

1. Run the installation script on every developer machine
    

To install the pre-push Git hook on every developer machine, run the [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) installation script on each machine. Make sure that the script is executed from the root directory of the Git repository.

You need to commit [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) and `pre-push` and run [`install-git-hooks.sh`](http://install-git-hooks.sh) . With this before every git push, command mentioned in pre-push will run (mvn verify), and if this fails, git push will be stopped.

To skip running a Git pre-hook, you can use the `--no-verify` flag when you push your code. For example, instead of running git push, you can run `git push --no-verify` to skip running any pre-hooks that have been configured in your Git repository.
