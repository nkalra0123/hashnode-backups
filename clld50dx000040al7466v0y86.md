### **Using Redis-CLI with a Redis Cluster**

When you use `redis-cli` to connect to a shard of a Redis Cluster, you are connected to that shard only, and cannot access data from other shards. If you try to access keys from the wrong shard, you will get a `MOVED` error.

Let's say we have a key "a" on one of the redis cluster nodes

```bash
redis-cli -p 7002
127.0.0.1:7002> keys *
1) "a"
```

And we connect to some other redis cluster nodes, and try to access that key

```bash
redis-cli -p 7000
127.0.0.1:7000> keys *
(empty array)
127.0.0.1:7000>
127.0.0.1:7000> get a
(error) MOVED 15495 127.0.0.1:7002
```

There is a trick you can use with `redis-cli` so you don’t have to open connections to all the shards, but instead you let it do the connect and reconnect work for you. It’s the `redis-cli` cluster support mode, triggered by the `-c` switch:

```bash
redis-cli -c -p 7000
127.0.0.1:7000> keys *
(empty array)
127.0.0.1:7000> get a
-> Redirected to slot [15495] located at 127.0.0.1:7002
"b"
127.0.0.1:7002>
```
